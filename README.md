# SingleCellAnalysis

### 1. SingleCellScanpyAutomatedDataAnalysisWorkflow.ipynb
This is an end-to-end automated Python 3.7 script using Scanpy for analysis of Single Cell transcriptomic data. It runs in multiple steps for performing discrete tasks in the pipeline. The script is very-well commented and explained with step-by-step instructions on inputs and outputs and functions performed. It can also use input as excel file for filetring based on QC metrics for multiple datasets (Example File included: QCmetricsFilter.xlsx). The section for automated integration is under progress and will be updated soon.
